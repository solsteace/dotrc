# Neovim Config

I've been a fan of VIM motion. Back then, I've tried to config my own neovim. It was great at first, but overtime I was starting to get overwhelmed by it. Perhaps the younger me wasn't ready for that level of self-customization and just wanna be that cool kid among non-Neovim users. Haha, how silly my judgment was back then. From that point, I was mostly doing my coding session with VSCodium.

Now that years has passed, I think it's time to give another shot. Let's not make the same mistake as back then, let's do it!
